Momentum is an analogue of the Chrome Web Store app of the same name. The app shows the time and the user's name. The background image and welcome message change depending on the time of day.
The app has a clock, an image slider, weather widgets, an audio player, a day quote block, and settings. A local storage - local storage - is used to store the username and locality.
